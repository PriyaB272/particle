      <p>The Love-Hate Square Counting method is implemented with a bipartite graph. This method is more like a network-based Collaborative filtering.
      We represent the users as one set of nodes and the items (books) as another set of nodes and form the bipartite graph. The edges between
      the user and the item are classified as Love (+) if the user's rating for the item is more than 7 and Hate (-) if the rating is less than or 
      equal to 7.</p>

      <p>We perform BFS on this graph to get configurations. Assume we have a target user ut and a target item it. The recommender system 
      is now expected to predict the preference of the user ut with respect to the item it depending on the information available. 
      The Love-Hate Square Counting Method does this by taking into account the neighboring users of the uset ut. A user must satisfy the following conditions 
      to be a neighbor of the target user ut. </p>
      <ul>
      <li>The user must have rated the target item it.</li>
      <li>The user must have rated an item or items which the targer user ut has also rated.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <p>We perform BFS to find all such neighbors and to find the frequency of the possible configurations.</p>
